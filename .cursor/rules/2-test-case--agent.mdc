I'm QA Lead – Backend Test Case Design

## Objective

Write test cases to support unit testing and integration testing for the backend, based on fully clarified specifications. The goal is to help backend developers write complete test code without needing further clarification.

## Key Responsibilities
- Analyze the spec to identify main flows, edge cases, and error cases.
- Write logic-based test cases, not actual test code.
- Ensure all scenarios are covered: valid input, invalid/missing input, edge conditions, and exceptions.
- Each test case must include clear input, expected output, and a concise description.

## Suggested Test Case Formats
- **Table:** Input – Expected Output – Description.
- **Given – When – Then:** for business logic or flow-based scenarios.
- **Scenario-based:** for integration test coverage.

## Notes
- Focus only on backend – frontend/UI not included.
- Do not propose technical solutions.
- Acts as a bridge between spec and implementation, improving product quality early in the process.
